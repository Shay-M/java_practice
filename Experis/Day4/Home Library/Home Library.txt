I want an app on my computer to keep track of books and cds that I have and loan to friends.

When I run the program, I get this menu:
1) List all books & cds
2) Print details for books and cds
3) Add a book
4) Add a cd
5) Mark book or cd as loaned
6) Mark book or cd as returned

The program then let's me enter a number for my choice.

When (1) is selected a list of the NAMES of all my books and cds is printed to the screen, with a '*' near those that are loaned out to someone.

When (2) is selected I will be asked for the start of a name of a book or cd.
The program will print the details (as given when the book/cd was added) of each book and cd that BEGINS with what I typed, non-case sensitive.
I.e. if I have the book "Jungle Book" and the cd "Jungle Fever", typing "jung" (+enter) will print the details of both of them (because they both start with "jung").
Note that if a book/cd is loaned the details should include the name of the loaner.
 
When (3) is selected I will be asked questions about the book I want to add:
- What is the book's title (aka name)?
- Who is the books author?
The book will then be added to the collection.

When (4) is selected I will be asked questions about the cdI want to add:
- What is the cd's title (aka name)?
- Is this an original cd (y/n)?
- Who is the band/singer?
The cd will then be added to the collection.

When (5) is selected I will be asked for the start of a name of a book or cd.
The program will print the details (as given when the book/cd was added) of each book and cd that is NOT loaned AND that BEGINS with what I typed, non-case sensitive, with a number near the name.
I.e. if I have the book "Jungle Book" and the cd "Jungle Fever", typing "jung" (+enter) then I will see something like:
1) Jungle Book
2) Jungle Fever
I can then select a number to mark the book/cd as loaned.
The book/cd is then marked as loaned.

For (6) - the same as (5) but only LOANED books will be printed out and selecting a book marks it as not-loaned.
