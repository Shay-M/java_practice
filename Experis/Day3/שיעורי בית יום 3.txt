(1) Write a function that receives an array of strings arrStrings and a string toRemove.
The function returns a new array of Strings that is the same as the input array arrStrings except that all strings that were equal to toRemove are removed.

example: 
For strings array { "abc", "def", "hij", "yariv", "abc", "hij", "abc", "def" } and the string value "abc" the function will
return the array { "def", "hij", "yariv", "hij", "def" }

If arrStrings does not contain the string toRemove at all - throw an exception.

(2) Write a function that receives an array of integers and returns a sorted array
private static int[] printSorted(int[] arr) {
	...
}

int[] a1 = { 5, 12, 1, 8, 4 };
int[] sorted = printSorted(a1);
for (int val : sorted) {
	logger.log(Level.INFO, String.valueOf(val);
}


Will output:
1
4
5
8
12

Recommendation: Begin by writing a function for an array with only 2 numbers, then for an array with only 3 numbers, etc.

(3) Change the one-out-of-three program to use arrays

(4) What will the program ArraysAndChange.java print?
TRY AND DECIDE WITH OUT EXECUTING!
Use a memory drawing!!!
